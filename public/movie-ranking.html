<h1>Movie / anime List</h1>
<p>This is a list of my Favourite movies and animes</p>
<hr />
<h2>Hunter x Hunter</h2>
<p>Not the first anime that I wanted but I have yet to find an anime that I love more that Hunter x Hunter</p>
<h2>One punch Man</h2>
<p>The story might be simple the animation for the fight scenes are a cut above anything I have watched</p>
<h2>Spiderman into the spider-verse</h2>
<p>Arguably my favourite movie of all time, the visuals were breath taking and the music (ft Post Malone) were amazing</p>
